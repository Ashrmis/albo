* Tasks
** DONE change absolute paths to relative
** TODO confirm and fix: broken spacing after biasfield correction
After biasfield correction, the spacing seems to have reverted from (3,3,3) to the default values
** DONE replace elastix apply mask with own implementation
** TODO error handling
extract_features: handle mismatch between featureconfig and provided image paths
** TODO rethink handling of sequence-lists as parameters
sequence-lists are passed by reference, manipulation in assembly function necessiates explicit passing of copy
** TODO make sure all outputs are reused if present 
- medpy intensity range standardization: replace out_dir with out_file
- extract_features: dynamically traited output?
- apply_rdf: dynamically traited input?
- merge extract_features and apply_rdf?
** TODO enhancement: simpler subflows
Remove input- and outputnodes, instead store "ports" as instance variables. Use custom methods to connect subflows. (Metaflow class necessary?)
